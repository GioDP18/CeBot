## üí≥ Step 2: Set Up Billing

### 2.2 Add Payment Method
1. Click **"Add payment method"**
2. **Choose payment type**:
   - **Credit Card** (Visa, Mastercard, American Express)
   - **PayPal** (if available in your region)

#### Credit Card Setup
1. **Enter card details**:
   - Card number (16 digits)
   - Expiry date (MM/YY)
   - CVC/CVV (3-4 digits on back)
   - Cardholder name (exactly as on card)

2. **Choose amount**:
   - **$5** - Good for testing (~2,500-8,000 messages)
   - **$10** - Recommended for initial development (~5,000-16,000 messages)
   - **$20** - For extended testing (~10,000-32,000 messages)
3. **Confirm purchase**
4. Wait for payment processing (usually instant)

### 2.4 Set Usage Limits (Recommended)
1. In Billing section, find **"Usage limits"**
2. **Set monthly limit**:
   - **Soft limit**: $5-10 (gets warning email)
   - **Hard limit**: $15-20 (stops API access)
3. **Add notification email** (your email address)
4. Click **"Save"**

---

## üîê Step 3: Generate API Key

### 3.1 Navigate to API Keys
1. In the left sidebar, click **"API keys"**
2. You'll see the API keys management page
3. Any existing keys will be listed here

### 3.2 Create New API Key
1. **Click "Create new secret key"**
2. **Name your key**:
   - Enter: `CeBot-Integration` (or similar descriptive name)
   - This helps you identify the key later
3. **Set permissions** (if available):
   - **Read**: For reading account info
   - **Write**: For making API calls (required)
   - Leave default settings if unsure
4. Click **"Create secret key"**

### 3.3 Copy and Secure Your API Key
1. **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: The API key will only be shown **ONCE**
2. **Copy the entire key**:
   - It starts with `sk-`
   - Example format: `sk-aBcD1234567890eFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ`
3. **Store securely**:
   - **DON'T** save in a text file on desktop
   - **DON'T** share via email or messaging
   - **DO** use a password manager
   - **DO** save in your project's `.env` file immediately

### 3.4 Test Your API Key
1. **Important**: Test immediately to ensure it works
2. We'll do this in the next step using the provided test script

---

## üß™ Step 4: Verify Setup

### 4.1 Add API Key to CeBot
1. **Open your CeBot project**
2. **Navigate to**: `backend/.env`
3. **Add the line**:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
   ```
4. **Replace** `sk-your-actual-api-key-here` with your actual API key
5. **Save the file**

### 4.2 Test the Integration
1. **Open terminal** in your CeBot backend directory
2. **Run the test script**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node test-openai.js
   ```

3. **Expected successful output**:
   ```
   üß™ Testing OpenAI connection...
   
   ‚úÖ OpenAI connection successful!
   üìù Test response:
   Hello! I can help you find transport routes in Cebu City...
   
   üí∞ Token usage:
      - Prompt tokens: 25
      - Completion tokens: 15
      - Total tokens: 40
      - Estimated cost: $0.000080
   ```

4. **If you see errors**:

   **‚ùå Error 429 - Quota Exceeded** (Most Common):
   ```
   ‚ùå OpenAI connection failed: 429 You exceeded your current quota
   ```
   **This means you need to add billing/credits to your OpenAI account**:
   - Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
   - Add a payment method (credit card)
   - Purchase initial credits ($5-10 minimum)
   - Wait 5-10 minutes for processing
   - Try the test again

   **‚ùå Invalid API Key**:
   ```
   ‚ùå OpenAI connection failed: Invalid API key
   ```
   - Double-check the key in `.env` file
   - Ensure no extra spaces or characters
   - Verify key hasn't been revoked
   - Try generating a new key

   **‚ùå Rate Limit**:
   ```
   ‚ùå OpenAI connection failed: Rate limit exceeded
   ```
   - Wait 1 minute and try again
   - This is temporary, usually resolves quickly

- **Output cost**: $0.0020 per 1K tokens (~750 words)
- **Typical CeBot message**: 100-300 tokens
- **Cost per message**: $0.0002-$0.0006

### 5.2 Usage Dashboard
1. **Go to**: https://platform.openai.com/account/usage

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### "You exceeded your current quota" (Error 429) - MOST COMMON
```bash
‚ùå OpenAI connection failed: 429 You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details
```
**This is the #1 issue for new users. It means billing is not set up properly.**

**Step-by-step solution**:
1. **Go to OpenAI Billing**: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. **Check your current plan**: 
   - If you see "Free tier" - you need to upgrade
   - If you see "$0.00 remaining" - you need to add credits
3. **Add payment method**:
   - Click "Add payment method"
   - Enter credit card details
   - Verify billing address
4. **Purchase credits**:
   - Click "Add credits"
   - Start with $5-10 (minimum for API access)
   - Confirm purchase
5. **Wait for processing** (5-10 minutes)
6. **Try the test again**: `node test-openai.js`

**Important Notes**:
- Free tier gives very limited API access (often $0)
- You need to add a credit card to use the API properly
- Minimum practical amount is $5-10
- Credits don't expire

#### "Invalid API Key"
```bash
‚ùå OpenAI connection failed: Invalid API key
```
**Solutions**:
- Double-check the key in `.env` file
- Ensure no extra spaces or characters
- Verify key hasn't been revoked
- Try generating a new key

#### "Insufficient Quota"
```bash
‚ùå OpenAI connection failed: You exceeded your current quota
```
**Solutions**:
- Add more credits in billing section
- Check if payment method is valid
- Wait for credit processing (can take 5-10 minutes)
- Verify billing information

#### "Rate Limit Exceeded"
```bash
‚ùå OpenAI connection failed: Rate limit exceeded
```
**Solutions**:
- Wait 1 minute between requests
- Upgrade to paid plan for higher limits
- Reduce frequency of API calls
- Consider using local AI for testing

#### "Network Error"
```bash
‚ùå OpenAI connection failed: Network Error
